# Motivation
We have seen that taking a derivative is a linear operation.
That is, if $f$ and $g$ are differentiable functions and $c$ is a constant, then 
$\begin{multline*} \dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x)+g(x)) = \dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x)) + \dfrac{d}{dx}(g(x)) \end{multline*}$
and, 
$\dfrac{d}{dx}(cf(x)) = c\dfrac{d}{dx}(f(x))$
However, it is not the case that the derivative of a product/quotient of functions is the product/quotient of derivatives.

# The Product Rule 
Let $f$ and $g$ be differentiable functions, We Have 
$(fg)'(x) = f(x)g'(x) + f'(x)g(x)$

The above equation above is the **Product Rule** for dfferentiation 
A good reminder :
"Derivative of product of functions is equal to : first function times derivative of second plus second times derivative of first"

# The Quotient Rule 
Let $f$ and $g$ be differentiable and let $g(x)\neq 0$. We have 
$\begin{multline*} \dfrac{d}{dx}(\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}) = \dfrac{f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^{2}} \end{multline*}$

The equation above is known as the **Quotient Rule**
A good reminder :
"$f(x)$ is the _high_ function, $g(x)$ is the _low_ function, the derivative of the quotient is given by - low d-high minus high d-low all over low squared."

# Trigonometric Derivatives
1. $\dfrac{d}{dx}\sin(x) = \cos(x)$
2. $\dfrac{d}{dx}\cos(x) = -\sin(x)$
3. $\dfrac{d}{dx}\tan(x) = \sec^{2}(x)$
4. $\dfrac{d}{dx}\csc(x) = -\csc(x)\tan(x)$
5. $\dfrac{d}{dx}\sec(x) = \sec(x)\tan(x)$
6. $\dfrac{d}{dx}\cot(x) = -\csc^{2}(x)$
