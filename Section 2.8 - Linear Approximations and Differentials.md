# Motivation 
If $f$ is a function that is differentiable at $x=a$, we can find the equation for the line tangent to the curve $y=f(x) at (a, f(x))$ via
$y = f'(a)(x-a)+f(a)$
when $x$ is close to $a$, 
$f(x) \approx f'(a)(x-a)+f(a)$
 The process in the above equation is called linearization of $f$ at $a$
 
 # Relative Error
 We can also view error in measurement relative to the variable itself.
 
 $\dfrac{\Delta V}{V} \approx \dfrac{dV}{dt} = \dfrac{4\pi r^{2}dr}{\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}} = 3\dfrac{dr}{r} = 3\dfrac{0.05}{21} \approx 0.0071$
 Multiplying by $100$ gives us the _percent error_
 i.e. percent error in volume $\approx 0.0071 \cdot 100 = 0.71%$
 In general, relative error -> $\frac{dy}{y}$ and percent error -> $\frac{dy}{y} \cdot 100$
