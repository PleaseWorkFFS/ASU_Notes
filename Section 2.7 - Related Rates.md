We have been discussing derivatives and rates for functions of a single variable.
We have also been studying relations between variables via function expression.
The objective now is to try and describe one quantities' rate of change in terms of another quantities' rate of change.

###### Air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases at the rate of $100 cm^{3}/sec$. How fast is the radius of the balloon increasing when the diameter of the balloon on $50 cm$ ?
$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3} , \frac{dv}{dt} = 100 cm^{3}/sec$
We wanna find rate of increase for radius when $d = 50 cm , r = 25 cm$

$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}$
$\dfrac{dV}{dt} = \dfrac{d}{dv}(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3})$
$\dfrac{dV}{dt} = 4\pi r^{2}\dfrac{dr}{dt}$
We know $\frac{dV}{dt} = 100 cm^{3}/sec$, and we are concerned about the rate of increase of the radius when $r = 25 cm$.
$100 = 4\pi (25)^{2}\dfrac{dr}{dt}$
$\dfrac{dr}{dt} = \dfrac{100}{4(25)^{2}\pi}$
Thus, when $d = 50 cm$, $\dfrac{dr}{dt} = \dfrac{1}{25\pi} cm/sec$
